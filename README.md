# An-Emulator-for-Smart-Radio-Environment
This project provides a Software Emulator for RIS-assisted wireless communication systems.  The emulator is designed to replicate the behavior of Software Defined Radios (SDRs) and RIS at the baseband and passband levels, allowing researchers and developers to evaluate wireless networks without requiring physical hardware.
